## How to answer Exercises

1. Create a new file for each exercise named `exercise1.lua`, `exercise2.lua`, etc.
2. Write your code in the corresponding file.
3. Run the tests using the `Testing` tab in the sidebar of VS Code.

## Exercise 1 - making variables of different types

1. Create a variable named `contains_nothing` and assign it to a nil value.
2. Create a variable named `some_boolean` and assign it to a boolean value.
3. Create a variable named `some_string` and assign it to a string value.
4. Create a variable named `some_number` and assign it to a number value.
5. Print out all the variables you created.

## Exercise 2 - using constants and string concatenation

1. Create a constant named `FIRST_NAME` and assign it to your name.
2. Create a constant named `LAST_NAME` and assign it to your age.
3. Create a constant named `FULL_NAME` and assign it to the concatenation of `FIRST_NAME` and `LAST_NAME` separated by a space.
4. Print out `FULL_NAME`.

## Exercise 3 - arithmetic operations

1. Create a variable named `a` and assign it to the number 10.
2. Create a variable named `b` and assign it to the number 5.
3. Create a variable named `sum` and assign it to the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. Create a variable named `difference` and assign it to the difference of `a` and `b`.
5. Create a variable named `product` and assign it to the product of `a` and `b`.
6. Create a variable named `quotient` and assign it to the quotient of `a` and `b`.
7. Print out all the variables you created.

## Exercise 4 - order of operations

1. Create a variable named `result1` and assign it to the result of the expression `3 + 5 * 2`.
2. Create a variable named `result2` and assign it to the result of the expression `(3 + 5) * 2`.
3. Print out both `result1` and `result2`.

## Exercise 5 - combining strings and numbers

1. Create a variable named `age` and assign it to your age.
2. Create a variable named `greeting` and assign it to the string `"Hello, I am "`.
3. Create a variable named `full_greeting` and assign it to the concatenation of `greeting` and `age`.
4. Print out `full_greeting`.
